# Discord Data Analyzer

Discord's new checkpoint feature, a year in review feature, doesn't work if you have sensible privacy settings enabled. That said, most of what they show you is information you can get just by requesting your [discord data package](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360004957991-Your-Discord-Data-Package). This script lets you quickly visualize messages sent and your top DM recipients and active servers.

## How to Run

1. Unzip your discord package in this directory as `discord-package`
2. Update the `YEAR` in `main.py` to the desired year
3. Run `main.py`
